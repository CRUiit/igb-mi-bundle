# igb-mi-bundle
A plugin to map genomic regions to protein interactions in the Integrated Genomic Browser.

We have developed an extension for the Integrated Genome Browser,
a widely used tool for the visualization and analyzes of genomic data, 
which maps and visualizes genomic regions in molecular interactions 
structures (protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and 
protein-small molecule interactions) and allows the researcher 
to make educated guesses about the functional impact of somatic mutations.

The source code will be made available soon.
