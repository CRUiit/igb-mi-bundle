     <h1>The Molecular Interaction Bundle</h1>
     
     
     
<h3>About</h3>
The <b>Molecular Interaction bundle</b> for IGB allows for mapping genomic regions to molecular interactions and structures.
The Bundle has been developed by Arnaud Ceol (arnaud.ceol@iit.it) at the <a href="http://genomics.iit.it">Center for Genomic Science</a> of the <a href="http://www.iit.it">Istituto Italiano di Technologia</a> in Milan (Italy).<br/>

<br/>More information about this bundle (including help page and tutorials) is available online at the address <a href="http://cru.genomics.iit.it/igbmibundle">http://cru.genomics.iit.it/igbmibundle</a>.

<h2><a id="search"></a>Search</h2>
<img src="pictures/searchpanel.png" alt="search" />

<h3>Search mode</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Extend: </b> find interaction between the product of selected genes and any other molecules.</li>
    <li><b>Connect:</b> find interactions between the product of selected genes only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data sources</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Interactions: </b> choose an interaction database. The list of databases
        is retrieved from the PSICQUIC registry (). Choose <b>== none ==</b> if you are 
    only interested by interactions with structures.</li>
    <li><b>Structure:</b>: PDB, Interactome3D or DSysMap. With PDB and Interactome3D
        the contacts are calculated by the plugin. With DSysMap, contact at 
        mutated positions are imported. Choose <b>== none ==</b> if you are 
    not interested in structures.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>RNA/DNA and small molecules:</b> check those boxes to include interactions
        with molecules other than proteins.
    </li>
    <li><b>Modified residues:</b> include modified residues (PTMs).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Extended search: press <b>&gt;&gt;</b></h3>
When the search box is visible (press button <b>&gt;&gt;</b> to show), the search 
is done on the regions added to the box. When the search box is hidden, 
(press button <b>&lt;&lt;</b> to hide), the search 
is done on the regions selected in the browser. 
<ul>
    <li><b>Add: </b> add selected regions to the list.</li>
    <li><b>Remove:</b> remove selected region to the list.</li>
    <li><b>Clear:</b> remove all regions from the list.</li>
    <li><b>Add track: </b> add all regions from selected tracks.</li>
    <li><b>Search and add: </b> perform a text search on all regions. All regions found
        are added to the list.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Result tab</h3>
<img src="pictures/results.png" alt="search" />
<h4>Buttons</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b><img src="pictures/icon-log.png" alt="log" />Log:</b> display the log for current query. If an error occurs, the
    icon will be display over a red background.</li>
    <li><b><img src="pictures/icon-network.png" alt="network" />Network:</b> display the network as a graph.</li>
    <li><b><img src="pictures/icon-save-txt.png" alt="txt" />Save (text format):</b> save the results in a tab-delimited file.</li>
    <li><b><img src="pictures/icon-save-xgmml.png" alt="xgmml" />Save (xgmml):</b> save the results in the xgmml format, which may be 
        loaded in network visualization browsers like Cytoscape.</li>
    <li><b><img src="pictures/icon-jmol.png" alt="jmol" />Jmol:</b> view selected structure in Jmol.</li>
    <li><b><img src="pictures/icon-link.png" alt="link" />Link: </b> open the link to the original database in an external browser.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>Result table</h4>

If you select any line on this table, the respective structures will be listed 
in the structure table.

<ul>
    <li><b>Track: </b> by default, the contacts found for all genomic regions
    for current queries are merged in a single track. It is possible to press
    this button to create a new track that displays only the contacts for the 
    specific interactions. This allow to compare the interface of a protein
    with different partners.</li>
    <li><b>Gene:</b> gene or molecule name. Double click on this cell to
    zoom onto the region associated in the browser.</li>
    <li><b>Reference: </b> for protein coding genes, its Uniprot Accession. Double 
        click on this cell to open the associated page of the Uniprot website 
    in an external browser. If the molecule is DNA, RNA or small molecule, its 
    formula or a label is displayed and the link forwards to PDB.</li>
    <li><b>Interaction type:</b> the one extracted from the protein 
        interaction database. If the interaction is imported from PDB, it is set 
        automatically to <b>association</b>, or <b>direct interactions</b> if 
    imported from Interactome3D.</li>
    <li><b>Diseases:</b> list of diseases associated to the proteins according 
        to Uniprot. The disease name is colored in <font color="green">green</font>if it is 
        associated to the first protein, in <font color="blue">blue</font> if 
        associated to the second protein, and <font color="orange">orange</font> if 
        common to both proteins.</li>
    <li><b>Structures:</b> colored squares are displayed id a structure is 
        available for this interaction. <font color="orange">Orange</font> border 
    indicates that a selected residue is mapped on the protein, <font color="red">
    red</font> border shows that a selected residues is in contact with the 
    other molecule.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Network visualization:</h4>
<table><tr><td><img src="pictures/network2.png" alt="network" /></td><td>
                <p>The interactions can be displayed in a graphical network. The type of molecule 
                    is represented by its color. A small black circle on one side
                    of an edge indicates that contacts have been detected on this
                    side of the interaction.
                </p></td></tr></table>

<h4>Structure table</h4>
The names of the structures is displayed in <font color="orange">orange</font> 
if a residue selected is mapped on the structure, <font color="red">red</font> 
it is in contact with the  other molecule.
    
<h3>New tracks in the genome browser:</h3>
<table><tr><td><img src="pictures/symmetries.png" alt="tracks" /></td><td><p>New tracks are create for each result. The tracks displays either the genes
which products are involved in an interactions or the residues found at the 
interface between a protein and another molecule.</p>

<p>The elements in the new track are represented as red horizontal lines with vertical
sticks at the positions that encode for residues at an interaction interface. 
If no contact residues was found, a black vertical bar is displayed over the region
that encode a selected or interacting gene.</p></td></tr></table>

<h3>The Jmol window</h3>
<table><tr><td><img src="pictures/jmol.png" alt="jmol" /></td><td>
The structures can be displayed in a Jmol window. It is possible to access to all
the Jmol options and feature by right clicking on the window. The chains that 
represent the first protein are colored in green, the chains that represent the
second protein in blue, and the other types of molecules (DNA, RNA, ligands) in 
yellow. The selected residues are colored in red if they are in contact with the
other molecule, in orange otherwise.</td></tr></table>

<h4>File cache</h4>
<p>The MI Bundle stores localy files
such as structures (pdb) or interaction lists. 
You can clear those files to free disk space. They will be
automatically downloaded next time the plugin needs them.</p>

<h4>PDB local mirror</h4>
<p>If you maintain a local mirror of PDB,
you can use it to avoid downloading the data.
The PDB mirror should maintain the hierarchical structure of 
PDB directory.</p>

<h4>Interactome3D local mirror</h4>
<p>If you maintain a local mirror
or Interactome3D, you can use it to avoid downloading the data.
The Interactome3D mirror should contain
interactions.dat, proteins.dat and all Interactome3D
structures in PDB format.</p>
